	<h2> Environmentalism </h2>
		<p> I initially came to Trinity to study Earth Sciences and while I choose to leave that degree to persue 
		Computer Science instead, I am still a passionate enviromnetalist with a lot of history and experience.
		</p>
		<h2> Below are some of the campaigns I have been involed with in Trinity. </h2>
		<h3> Fossil Free TCD </h3>
		<p> A Student lead campaign launched in 2015 with the aim to make Trinity divest from fossil fuels, I joined in 2016
			and spent a year campaigning and helping to run the movement. We achieved success in late 2017.
